## Version

**v1.2.0** - Phase 3 release with analytics and planning features

## Part of Playeola Marketplace

This is Phase 3 of the Playeola plugin ecosystem:

- **Phase 1** âœ… `playeola-foundation` - Code review, documentation, smart commit

## Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

1. **Use `/implement-analytics` for guided analytics implementation** - Don't start from scratch
2. **Use `/brainstorm-feature` for complex features** - Structure saves time
3. **Let agents auto-invoke** - Hooks will suggest the right agent at the right time
4. **Create SESSION_STATE.md for tracking** - Keep implementation progress visible
5. **Trust the performance guidance** - Analytics-champion knows optimization patterns
6. **Document decisions as you go** - Use feature-architect for ADRs
7. **Test with realistic data** - Always validate performance at scale
8. **Iterate on specifications** - Plans evolve, update documents accordingly

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Triggering
- Use analytics keywords (dashboard, metrics, visualization) for `analytics-champion`
- Use planning keywords (brainstorm, feature, plan) for `feature-architect`
- Check that hooks are enabled in `hooks/hooks.json`

### Slow Dashboard Performance
- Invoke `analytics-champion` explicitly for optimization guidance
- Check database indexes
- Review query execution plans
- Consider materialized views
- Add caching layer

### Feature Planning Overwhelming
- Start with `/brainstorm-feature` command for structure
- Focus on MVP first
- Break large features into phases
- Document one decision at a time

### Analytics Implementation Complex
- Use `/implement-analytics` for step-by-step guidance
- Start with simple metrics first
- Build incrementally
- Test each component separately

## Example Document Outputs

### Technical Specification
When using `/brainstorm-feature`, generates:
- `specs/[feature-name].md` - Complete technical specification
- Problem statement, requirements, design, user flows
- Testing strategy and rollout plan
- Risks, mitigations, and open questions

### Implementation Plan
Also generates:
- `plans/[feature-name]-implementation.md` - SESSION_STATE.md style
- Task breakdown by phase
- Progress tracking sections
- Decisions and notes sections
- Next steps clearly defined
