Agent Facilitation:

Phase 1: Ideation
- Q: What's the goal? (Increase revenue, player engagement?)
- Q: How should it work? (Pre-game or in-game purchase?)
- Q: What's the pricing strategy? (Fixed multiple of bet?)
- Q: Any regulatory constraints?

Phase 2: Requirements
- Functional: Purchase button, price calculation, bonus trigger
- Non-functional: Must maintain RTP, fast transaction, audit trail
- User story: "As a player, I want to buy bonus directly to experience free spins without waiting"

Phase 3: Design
- RGS: New endpoint /bonus-buy, update game math
- Game Engine: UI for purchase flow, balance check
- Backoffice: Analytics for bonus buy metrics
- Math: Adjust RTP with bonus buy contribution

Phase 4: Planning
Tasks:
1. [M] Update RGS math engine with bonus buy logic - 2 days
2. [M] Add bonus buy API endpoint - 1 day
3. [M] Create purchase UI in Game Engine - 2 days
4. [S] Update Backoffice analytics - 1 day

Phase 3: Design
- New service: Jackpot Service (manages pool, contributions)
- RGS: Integrate with Jackpot Service on each spin
- Game Engine: Display live jackpot meter
- Backoffice: Jackpot configuration and monitoring
- Database: Jackpot transactions, history

Phase 4: Planning
High complexity - needs careful coordination:
