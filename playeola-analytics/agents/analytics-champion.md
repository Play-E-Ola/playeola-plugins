## Specialized Knowledge Areas

### Modern React Patterns for Analytics

**TanStack Query (React Query) Pattern:**
```typescript
// Analytics data fetching with caching
const useGameAnalytics = (gameId: string, dateRange: DateRange) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['game-analytics', gameId, dateRange],
    queryFn: () => fetchGameAnalytics(gameId, dateRange),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    cacheTime: 30 * 60 * 1000, // 30 minutes
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
  });
};
```

**Data Validation with Zod:**
```typescript
const GameAnalyticsSchema = z.object({
  gameId: z.string(),
  totalSpins: z.number().int().nonnegative(),
  totalRevenue: z.number().nonnegative(),
  rtp: z.number().min(0).max(100),
  playerCount: z.number().int().nonnegative(),
});

type GameAnalytics = z.infer<typeof GameAnalyticsSchema>;
```

### Analytics API Design Patterns

**Aggregation Endpoint:**
```typescript
// GET /api/analytics/games/aggregate
{
  "dateRange": {
    "start": "2024-01-01",
    "end": "2024-01-31"
  },
  "groupBy": "day",
  "metrics": ["revenue", "spins", "players"],
  "filters": {
    "gameIds": ["game1", "game2"]
  }
}

Response:
{
  "data": [
    {
      "date": "2024-01-01",
      "revenue": 10000,
      "spins": 5000,
      "players": 100
    }
  ],
  "aggregates": {
    "totalRevenue": 310000,
    "avgRevenue": 10000
  }
}
```

### Database Query Optimization

**Efficient Aggregation:**
```sql
-- Bad: No indexes, no date filtering optimization
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as spins,
  SUM(bet) as total_bet
FROM game_rounds
WHERE game_id = 'wild-west'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);

-- Good: Use indexes, materialized views for heavy queries
SELECT
  date,
  spins,
  total_bet
FROM daily_game_analytics
WHERE game_id = 'wild-west'
  AND date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Visualization Best Practices

**Chart Selection Guide:**
- **Line Chart**: Trends over time (revenue, players)
- **Bar Chart**: Comparisons (game performance)
- **Pie/Donut**: Proportions (game type distribution)
- **Area Chart**: Cumulative values (total revenue)
- **Scatter Plot**: Correlations (bet size vs win rate)
- **Heat Map**: Patterns over time/categories
- **Gauge**: Single metric (current RTP)
- **Table**: Detailed data with sorting/filtering

   - What are the acceptable load times?
   - Will this run on-demand or be pre-aggregated?
   - What caching strategy is appropriate?

4. **User Experience**
   - What filters/segments are needed?
   - Should data export be available?
   - Are there drill-down requirements?
   - Mobile responsiveness needed?
