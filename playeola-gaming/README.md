## Installation

This plugin is installed via the Playeola marketplace:

```bash
# Add marketplace (if not already added)
/plugin marketplace add Play-E-Ola/playeola-plugins

# Install this plugin
/plugin install playeola-gaming@playeola-marketplace
```

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Adding Sticky Wilds Feature

```
You: I need to add sticky wilds to Wild West Slots

Claude: [invokes slot-game-specialist agent]

Agent Analysis:
- Reviews current wild symbol implementation
- Designs sticky wild mechanics
- Calculates feature impact on RTP
- Provides implementation in both math and presentation layers
- Suggests Phaser animation patterns
- Creates test cases

Result: Feature implemented with verified math and smooth animations
```

### Scenario 2: New RGS API Endpoint

```
You: I added a bonus buy endpoint to RGS

Claude: [invokes microservices-orchestrator agent]

Agent Analysis:
- Identifies consumers (Game Engine, Backoffice)
- Validates API contract
- Checks backward compatibility
- Suggests integration tests

You: /sync-service-docs

Claude:
‚úÖ Updated RGS: docs/api/bonus-buy.md
‚úÖ Updated Game Engine: docs/integration/rgs-client.md (added bonus buy example)
‚úÖ Updated Backoffice: docs/analytics/game-features.md

Result: All services have updated documentation
```

### Scenario 3: RTP Investigation

```
You: The Math Simulator shows 95.8% RTP but we designed for 96.5%

Claude: [invokes slot-game-specialist agent]

Agent Analysis:
- Reviews paytable configuration
- Analyzes symbol weights
- Checks feature contribution to RTP
- Identifies discrepancy in free spin calculation
- Provides corrected configuration

Result: RTP corrected to match design spec
```

### Scenario 4: Breaking API Change

```
You: I changed the RGS spin response format

Claude: [invokes microservices-orchestrator agent]

Agent Warning:
‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking change detected!
Affected services: Game Engine (critical), Math Simulator (important)

Recommendation: API versioning strategy
- Keep v1 for backward compatibility
- Introduce v2 endpoint
- Provide 6-week migration timeline

You: /sync-service-docs

Claude:
‚úÖ Created docs/api/v2/spin-endpoint.md
‚úÖ Created migration guide: docs/migrations/v1-to-v2.md
‚úÖ Updated all consuming services with migration path
‚úÖ Added deprecation notices

Result: Safe rollout with clear migration path
```

## Works With

### Game Development
- **Game Engine** - Phaser-based slot games
- **Math Simulator** - RTP validation and calculations
- **RGS** - Server-side game logic

### Microservices
- **RGS** ‚Üî **Game Engine** - Game round communication
- **RGS** ‚Üî **Math Simulator** - Math validation
- **RGS** ‚Üî **Backoffice** - Analytics and configuration
- **Website** ‚Üî **RGS** - Session management and game launching

## Integration with Phase 1

This plugin builds on `playeola-foundation`:

**Inherits from Phase 1:**
- `code-review-expert` - Still enforces code quality
- `documentation-orchestrator` - Powers `/sync-service-docs`
- `/smart-commit` - Still available for quality commits

**Adds Phase 2 Capabilities:**
- Gaming expertise (slot mechanics, Phaser)
- Microservices orchestration
- Cross-service documentation sync

**Recommendation:** Install both plugins for full functionality:
```bash
/plugin install playeola-foundation@playeola-marketplace
/plugin install playeola-gaming@playeola-marketplace
```

## Project Adaptation

Like Phase 1, this plugin automatically adapts to your project:

**Game Configuration:**
- Discovers game config structure
- Adapts to your paytable format
- Works with any RTP target

**Service Architecture:**
- Maps your specific service dependencies
- Adapts to your API patterns
- Handles any communication protocol

**Documentation Structure:**
- Discovers each service's doc layout
- Maintains your existing organization
- No assumptions about file locations

## Version

**v1.1.0** - Phase 2 release with gaming and microservices features

## Part of Playeola Marketplace

This is Phase 2 of the Playeola plugin ecosystem:

- **Phase 1** ‚úÖ `playeola-foundation` - Code review, documentation, smart commit
- **Phase 2** ‚úÖ `playeola-gaming` - Gaming specialists & microservices (this plugin)
- **Phase 3** üöß `playeola-analytics` - Analytics workflows & feature planning
- **Phase 4** üöß `playeola-advanced` - Advanced orchestration & PR automation

## Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

1. **Let agents auto-invoke** - The hooks will suggest the right agent at the right time
2. **Use `/sync-service-docs` early** - Don't wait until all changes are done
3. **Leverage both agents together** - They collaborate on cross-service gaming features
4. **Trust the math validation** - `slot-game-specialist` knows RTP calculations
5. **Version breaking changes** - Follow the v1/v2 pattern for API changes

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Triggering
- Check that hooks are enabled in `hooks/hooks.json`
- Use gaming keywords (slot, rtp, phaser) to trigger `slot-game-specialist`
- Use service keywords (api, endpoint, rgs) to trigger `microservices-orchestrator`

### Documentation Not Syncing
- Ensure documentation directories exist in services
- Check that `/sync-service-docs` can detect your API changes
- Verify `documentation-orchestrator` from Phase 1 is available

### RTP Calculations Seem Wrong
- Invoke `slot-game-specialist` explicitly for deep analysis
- Review paytable configuration files
- Check Math Simulator integration
